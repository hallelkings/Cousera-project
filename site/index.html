<div class="aboutus">About Us</div>
<div class="mainpoint"><p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">The Royals is a Nigerian Music Channel founded by Hallel Kings in the year 2021. They are versatile when it comes to Music production, which ranges from EDM to Pop to Afropop etc. Their songs are usually identified with emotional melodies usually made with the guitar or piano, flowing rythm, and a bit of African vibe to some of their songs. The songs uploaded on their YouTube Channel also includes those made by talented Musicians, Producers, Songwriters, Remixers and the likes.</p></div>
<div class="aboutus">How We Started</div>
<div class="mainpoint"><p class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">Before the founding of Kings Music, the founder of this Channel/Label (Hallel Kings) who was a beatmaker, made a statistic and found out that there are many aspiring, talented musicians out there who do not have sufficient fund/money to pursue their dreams. So he decided to do what he could to put an end to that. He decided not to sell his Beats/Instrumentals anymore (It's not for free either), but to use them in supporting talented upcoming artistes and the likes with no funds. He made a strategy by uploading those Instrumentals to his YouTube Channel and other streaming Platforms, thereby indicating that they could be used by any interested artiste, only if they can write a song to it, record it (the quality of the recording does not matter initially), and mail it to the channel's official e-mail address. The artiste with the best written song will then be accepted to work with on that particular instrumental, with him/her spending $0.00 on the project. So with that project in mind, the Label/Channel was born.</p></div>
